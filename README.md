Author: Farhan-Ul-Haq (SAP ID: 55853)
Institution: Riphah International University
Course: Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
Supervisor: Sir Usman Sharif

üöÄ Overview
Welcome to the HCI-CG Lab Assignments Repository ‚Äî a comprehensive collection of 13 lab assignments designed to deepen your understanding of Human-Computer Interaction principles and their integration with Computer Graphics. This repository explores usability, interface design, prototyping, and practical application of HCI theories through various tools and programming languages.

The primary prototyping tool is Figma, supported by coding in Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

Analyzed cognitive processes to enhance UI design and user experience

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Farhanulhaq19/Human-Computer-Interaction-CG.git
cd Human-Computer-Interaction-CG
For Python-based labs (Lab 3 & Lab 4):
Ensure Python 3.x is installed.

Install dependencies:


pip install tkinter matplotlib numpy pandas selenium tkcalendar
For Selenium, download the Chrome WebDriver matching your Chrome version.

Run scripts:


python lab3/task_manager.py
For HTML/CSS/JS prototypes (Labs 5, 6, 10, 12):
Open HTML files directly in a browser or host locally:


python -m http.server 3000
Access via: http://127.0.0.1:3000

For Figma Prototypes (Labs 1, 11, 13):
